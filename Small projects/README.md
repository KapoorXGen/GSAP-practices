# 🎯 GSAP Animation Playground

This is a simple project built using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and **Tailwind CSS** to demonstrate different GSAP functions like `from`, `to`, `fromTo`, and `set`. It's interactive and beginner-friendly — perfect for experimenting with GSAP animations.

🔍 Features

- Interactive radio buttons to test various GSAP animation methods.
- Smooth transitions powered by GSAP.
- Clean and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- Reset functionality on each interaction for consistent behavior.

⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **GSAP (v3.13)**

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/KapoorXGen/GSAP---Small-Projects.git
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.
   (No build tools required — it's pure frontend.)

🧪 How It Works

Click one of the four animation types:

1. From – starts animation from a defined value and ends at current/default.
2. To – animates from current position to a defined value.
3. FromTo – defines both starting and ending values.
4. Set – instantly applies the values without animation.

Each time you select a different animation, the box resets to its original state and then performs the selected animation.
